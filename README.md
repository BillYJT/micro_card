# MUEEC Membership Card

Hello! Here are the design files for our membership card, which we have called 'micro_card'.

We are currently working on revision 5 for 2018 and will be releasing progressively more resources related to the board.

# What is this membership card about?

When you join to [MUEEC (Melbourne University Electrical Engineering Club)](http://www.mueec.com), you receive a cool and awesome membership card, so you can identify yourself as a member for our multiple events.

This card is also a PCB that can work as an Arduino Micro when assembled. We will be running workshops so you can learn how to solder SMD components and make good use of it.

But this is Open Hardware and as such, we are providing here with all the details you might need and won't find anywhere else.

# Project format

This PCB was made in Altium Designer. Which is a commercial software for PCB design...

But why??? Regardless of how much we love open hardware and software, Altium Designer is one of the most popular and industry standard professional software for PCB design.

It is also used in the Electrical Engineering course at Melbourne University. And we are all about helping students to learn useful professional skills.
